# eteration Task - Merdan Turan

In this project users can sort, filter, search items and add items to their cart. Also users can see their cart and total counts. 

If users leave or refresh the page, their previous searches, filtering, sorting and carts can be viewed in the same way when they return. These were made with the information stored in the users' local storage with the help of redux and redux persist libraries.
